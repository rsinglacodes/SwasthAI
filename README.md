# 🧠 SwasthAI – AI Health Assistant

SwasthAI is a **multimodal AI-powered healthcare web application** that predicts diseases using **symptoms and medical images**, provides explanations, stores user records, and includes an AI chatbot for guidance.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🩺 Disease Prediction

* Predict diseases based on selected symptoms
* Uses trained ML models (`model.pkl`, `svc.pkl`)
* Returns prediction with confidence score

### 📷 Medical Image Analysis

* Upload images (e.g., skin conditions)
* Uses deep learning model (`medical_image_model.h5`)
* Enhances prediction using image insights

### 🔍 Explainable AI

* Shows **important symptoms** contributing to prediction
* Helps users understand results

### 🤖 AI Chat Assistant

* Interactive chatbot for health queries
* Provides general precautions and suggestions

### 🗂 Records Management

* Stores predictions in `records.csv`
* View history via UI

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects symptoms
2. (Optional) Uploads medical image
3. ML model predicts disease
4. Image model refines confidence
5. Explanation is generated
6. Data is stored in records

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* Image model predictions depend on training dataset
* Ensure models in `/models` folder are properly trained
* Dataset must be preprocessed before training

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Use real medical datasets for higher accuracy
* Improve CNN model for skin disease detection
* Add NLP-based chatbot using LLM
* Deploy on cloud (Render / AWS)
* Mobile-friendly UI
